# ☕ Stellar Tip Jar

A decentralized tip jar web app built with **React** and the **Stellar blockchain (Testnet)**.  
Users can connect their Freighter wallet and send XLM tips directly — no middlemen, no fees.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/stellar-tip-jar.git
cd stellar-tip-jar

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

## 💡 How It Works

1. User opens the app in their browser
2. Clicks **"Connect Freighter Wallet"** — the Freighter extension asks for permission
3. App fetches and displays the user's XLM balance from Stellar Testnet
4. User selects a **preset tip** (5 or 10 XLM) OR types a **custom amount**
5. Clicks **Send** — Freighter popup appears to sign the transaction
6. Transaction is submitted to the Stellar Testnet network
7. Success message shows the transaction hash with a link to Stellar Explorer

---

## 🔑 Configuration

To use your own wallet address as the recipient, open `src/App.jsx` and replace:

```js
const MY_TIP_JAR_ADDRESS = "YOUR_TESTNET_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE";
```

> ⚠️ This project uses **Testnet only**. Do NOT use real/Mainnet keys.

## ❗ Top 3 Problems I Faced & Solutions

---

### 🔴 Problem 1: `signTransaction()` Returning an Object Instead of a String

**What happened:**  
The `@stellar/freighter-api` newer versions changed the return type of `signTransaction()`.  
Old versions returned a plain XDR string. Newer versions return an **object** like:
```js
{ signedTxXdr: "AAAAAgAAAA..." }
```
This caused the app to crash when trying to parse the transaction because it received `[object Object]` instead of a valid XDR string.

**Error seen:**
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined
```

**Solution:**  
Handle both old and new return formats safely:
```js
const signedXdr =
  typeof signResult === "string"
    ? signResult
    : signResult?.signedTxXdr ?? signResult;
```

---

### 🔴 Problem 2: `requestAccess()` Not Returning a Plain Public Key String

**What happened:**  
`requestAccess()` from Freighter used to return a plain public key string like `"GABC..."`.  
In newer versions it returns an **object**:
```js
{ address: "GABC...", network: "TESTNET" }
```
Calling `.slice()` directly on the object caused a blank or broken wallet display.

**Error seen:**
```
TypeError: pubKey.slice is not a function
```

**Solution:**  
Extract the key safely from whichever format is returned:
```js
const pubKey =
  typeof result === "string"
    ? result
    : result?.address ?? result?.publicKey ?? null;
```

---

### 🔴 Problem 3: `signTransaction()` Second Argument Format Was Wrong

**What happened:**  
The old code passed `"TESTNET"` as a plain string for the network:
```js
await signTransaction(transaction.toXDR(), "TESTNET");  // ❌ Old / wrong
```
Newer versions of Freighter require an **options object** with `networkPassphrase`:
```js
await signTransaction(transaction.toXDR(), {
  networkPassphrase: StellarSdk.Networks.TESTNET   // ✅ Correct
});
```
Without this fix, Freighter either rejects the request or signs on the wrong network.

**Solution:**  
Always pass the second argument as an object with the full network passphrase.

| 2 | **Freighter connect popup** — the extension asking for permission | After clicking "Connect Freighter Wallet" |
| 3 | **Connected dashboard** — showing wallet address, balance, tip buttons + custom input | After wallet is connected |
| 4 | **Freighter sign popup** — asking to approve the transaction | After clicking Send |
| 5 | **Success message** — green status box with transaction hash | After transaction is confirmed |
| 6 | **Stellar Explorer page** — the transaction detail page | Open the "View on Stellar Explorer" link |
